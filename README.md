COMP 562 Final Project: Fake or Real News Detection

Group members: Ziqian Xu, Yinuo Hu, Mingli Zhang, Xinran Ming

**The project report can be found [here](report.pdf).**

Because of the abundancy of information with various qualities available nowadays, we are interested in whether machine learning algorithms can classify fake news versus real news.

Data used in the project comes from https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset.

The following algorithms:

- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine
- Bi-directional LSTM 

are used to classify fake versus real news.
